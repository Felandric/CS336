Pattern 1: bills cannot be issued outside of bars operating hours

	SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM issued I JOIN bars B ON I.issuedby=B.name) T
	WHERE T.hour < T.openTime
	OR T.hour >= T.closeTime

	Result: 0 row(s) returned

Patern 2: drinkers cannot frequent bars in a different state from the one in which they live

	SELECT * FROM frequents F

	JOIN bars B

	ON F.bar=B.name 

	JOIN drinkers D

	ON F.drinker=D.name

	WHERE D.state <> B.state

	results: 0 row(s) returned

Pattern 3: For every two beers b1 and b2, different bars may charge differently for b1 and b2 but b1 should either be less expensive than b2 in ALL bars or more expensive than b2 in ALL bars
